EmuELEC CHANGELOG
==================

3.6
	
	* Fixed AdvanceMame gamepad auto-configuration, a new option to enable/disable this has been set in the Main Menu - EmuELEC Settings.
    * Removed steam controller support, I don't think anyone was using it and it was just eating resources, if many people ask for it I will enable it again.
    * Added small youtube search engine (needs a keyboard) for now its included in the Setup menu script #14.
    * Mplayer: Added support for .twi and .ytb files, if you include a file with a twitch or youtube address it will be played by mplayer (needs internet).
    * Added Skip Song to ES, using the left thumb button (l3) you can skip the current song.
    * Added a small (VERY BETA) way to view videos directly from ES, drop your .mp4, .mkv, mpg, .mov videos to /storage/roms/mplayer and they will appear in ES, it still needs theming, so they will show up withouth an image/icon.
    * Fixed splash screen on 720p resolution or below.
    * Enabled CEC support and Remote support for devices that support it.
    * ES now has some new options to play with including hiding extensions per platform, so if you have .bin/.cue files you can hide one of them and now have no doubles, its available on the "select" menu from a gamelist, under "view customisation" (which has a typo, but thats besides the point).
    * Flycast is now working again, plus added PSP to the no rewind list so it should work even with no rewind enabled globally (it didn't before). 
    * Most emulators have been updated to the latest git.
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Use upstream PPSSPPSDL instead of PPSSPPSDL-GO, there might be gamepad issues.
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Add support for V1.1 with extra buttons and WiFi module, buttons might have changed a bit, taking suggestions on how to best set them up!.
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Besides all the changes mentioned above a sleep mode added by @KiwiHop (many thanks!).
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Fixed a bug that would trigger a black screen on the OGA 10 min after waking up the device.
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Switched global HOTKEY to F5.
	* Synched with CoreELEC 9.2.3.
	* Small script cleanups, other bug fixes and few other tweaks I am forgetting probably.	
	 
	EmuELEC will now force copy es_systems.cfg because when changes were made upstream to es_systems.cfg the update did not copy the new file, this version fixes that.
	WARNING: This will REPLACE the es_systems.cfg file, if you manually changed this file those changes will need to be redone, sorry can't seem to find a better way yet.


3.5

* Fixed FPS on Emulationstation would drop after returning from a game (Amlogic-ng)
* Add ee_alsa.always option emuelec.cong use to dissable pulseaudio, this might fix some issues when returning from a game, you will loose mixing sounds in ES

* Probably other changes I forgot to mention

This is the first official release for the OGA, although there are still many know issues, bugs and changes needed I felt it is at a place where I could release

2.5 

Initial EmuELEC release

Sx05RE is now EmuELEC, a pure emulation build that does not include Kodi or anything else related to Kodi in order to free resources and space.
The main goal of EmuELEC is to be the best and easiest wat to emulate retro games on Amlogic hardware.

However if you still like to have Kodi on the same installation, you can also use the Kodi Add-on version. But keep in mind it will have less features than EmuELEC
